       "      <td>A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Two supermoons will be visible across Singapore in August 2023. This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash</td>\n",

       "      <td>The owner of the pet peacock that attacked a three-year-old girl on Nov. 28, 2021, was issued a stern warning. The police, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, administered a stern warning to the 59-year-old man on Jul. 3, 2023, for an offence of negligence concerning his pet peacock, the Singapore Police Force told Mothership. According to the police, the man has since given his peacock away and has paid compensation to the victim's family. On Nov. 28, 2021, the three-year-old girl was walking with her family along Tavistock Avenue when they spotted a house with a peacock. The girl's mother, Kris Chan, noted that the gate to the house was \"wide open\", and the peacock was inside the compound. However, when the three-year-old stood outside the gate and looked in, the peacock charged out and \"aggressively\" attacked the child. The family and the peacock's owner were then locked in a dispute over who should take responsibility for the attack. After apparently consulting their lawyers and the Animal &amp;amp; Veterinary Service (AVS), the owner maintained he was not at fault as the girl reportedly provoked the peacock by staring at it. The owner also apparently said he would decide how much to compensate the family after the medical bill has been tallied, if at all. In Singapore, it is legal to keep up to 10 non-commercial poultry, which includes peacocks. In response to Mothership's queries, Chan shared that she was disappointed with the results since the owner had been issued previous warnings before and that she provided the authorities evidence of other incidents involving multiple other victims prior to her daughter. \"We just hope to close the chapter and move on,\" she said. Speaking to The Straits Times (ST),Â Chan said that her family had to file a civil suit against the owner for him to pay for their daughter's medical fees. Chan also shared that her now five-year-old daughter has developed a fear of all animals, including dogs, cats and chickens. When her family visits friends with dogs at home, the dogs need to be muzzled and kept in a separate room. \"She's gradually getting better. We finally started going to the zoo again only this year,\" Chan said to ST. Top photos via Kris Chan/Facebook &amp;amp; Mandy How</td>\n",

Prices of Spotify plans are going up between S$1 and S$2, and will go into effect immediately for new sign-ups. However, current subscribers are given a month's \"grace\", meaning that their prices will not go up until August, or September in some cases. The new prices are as follows:     The new and current prices: Screenshot via Spotify The previous pricing plan, as of Mar. 25 2023. Screenshot from the Internet Archive, via Spotify Spotify is available as a free, ad-supported service. But users on Premium plans can use the service ad-free, as well as downloading music and podcasts to listen to offline. However, unlike Netflix, Spotify users cannot share accounts, as playing music on one device automatically stops it playing on another connected device. Spotify's press release boast of over 200 million users, and those users in 46 countries will encounter the price increases. Those countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many European nations. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Indonesia will also see their prices increase, although Malaysia seems to have remained the same for now. Spotify is not the only service seeking more revenue from their subscriptions, with The Verge reporting that services, such as Apple Music and YouTube Premium, have also increased by about US$1 in the past year. Netflix recently moved to restrict users from sharing passwords, traditionally a perk of the service. Users in over 100 countries including Singapore are now required to pay an additional fee in order to add a user from outside their households. While there was initially some uncertainty what the response to such a change might be, The Verge reported in June that Netflix enjoyed an increase in paid subscriptions. So look out for more price hikes. Top image via Unsplash</td>\n",

The mercury is set to hit a high of around 35 deg C on several days while some nights are expected to be warm, with temperatures of about 28 deg C. Some relief could come in the second week, with thundery showers expected between the late morning and afternoon in some parts on several days. But most parts of the island are expected to experience below average rainfall, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). The dry and warm conditions are due to a mass of dry air moving eastward from the Indian Ocean over the region, it added. The prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are also expected to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region. This monsoon season typically extends into September and is a drier period compared with other times of the year. The daily maximum temperature in July is forecast to be between 33 deg C and 34 deg C, slightly higher than the 32 deg C to 34 deg C on many days in June. June was cooler overall compared with the weather in May, as it saw more rainy days, with almost all parts of the island receiving above average rainfall.</td>\n",

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1). Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales. The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon. With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec). The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex). Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell). The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest. After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card). Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations. For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card). Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month. Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions. Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire. But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices. Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits. According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade. Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - After two years of restoration works, the Bukit Timah Railway Station and Railway Staff Quarters, located at about the midpoint of the 24km Rail Corridor, have reopened to the public. Visitors can now learn about the former railway line's history in the heritage gallery housed in the old railway station and relax at a cafe inside the former staff quarters, as well as enjoy new amenities, gardens and lawns. Officiating at the opening of the new 4.3ha Bukit Timah Railway Station community node on Friday (July 1), National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the public had been engaged on how to preserve the station's heritage. He said restoration plans had taken in an in-depth study of the site by Singapore University of Technology and Design students. Accessibility for people on wheelchairs, seniors, and families with young children was also taken into consideration. The node is located right by the Bukit Timah truss bridge and is most easily accessed from the King Albert Park MRT station. \"We have now conserved its two buildings and ensured that they are safe and accessible for everyone while retaining their nostalgic charm,\" said Mr Lee. For instance, in the railway station's signal room, six original levers used by station masters to control track switching and signalling for passing trains were kept. New gardens to enhance the station's character were also added, such as the Kampung Garden, which contains species including the hibiscus, peacock flower and jasmine found in 1960s kampungs here. Night lighting in the area will be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing nocturnal animals, said Mr Lee. Friday marks exactly 11 years since the 24km stretch of land occupied by the Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway line was returned to Singapore. Bukit Timah was one of several stations on the line, with the southern terminus being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) said visitors inside the Bukit Timah station building will get to see a ticketing booth and a replica of a signals diagram in the station's signal room. Conservator Yeo Kang Shua, who was the restoration project’s heritage consultant, said that while it was technically straightforward, the challenges lay in the relatively small scale of the heritage buildings. Workers had to be extremely cautious, he said, as any mistake they made would have damaged a significant percentage of the buildings given their size. For instance, special care was given to 20 half-domed ventilation tiles that were retained as part of the buildings’ roofs and are no longer in production. In front of the building, which was built in 1932, more restored features can be found, such as station signs and token poles. There are also replicas of railway station wagons that were used as railway maintenance vehicles. URA executive architect John Wan said the agency wanted to make the site relevant and used by the public, hence the wagons were introduced as a play feature and photo opportunity. At the former staff quarters, located opposite the old rail tracks from the station building, a cafe has opened at one of the two houses, offering local and fusion fare. Next door, a \"heritage wing\" has been created, retaining the layout, features and details of the house to showcase its former use as a residential building. Here, the toilet block has been spruced up and provides a showcase for how sanitation systems have evolved over past decades through displays of night-soil collection, a septic tank for on-site waste treatment and a modern sanitary system of underground lines with inspection chambers and a grease trap. Mr Marcus Wang, who owns 1932 Story, the new cafe in the staff quarters, said he was enticed to place a bid for the space having previously lived close to the railway line in a kampung near the former Bukit Timah Fire Station. “The request by NParks was not for a modern cafe, but one that reflected the olden times and as a furniture-maker, I thought I could contribute my passion,” said Mr Wang, who decorated the cafe space with some antiques of his own such as an old television. Last month, the Rail Corridor was identified as one of five identity corridors by URA in its heritage and identity structure plan. \"This means that we will plan the entire 24km length of the Rail Corridor with an intent to preserve this unique character,\" said Mr Lee on Friday. For instance, he said urban design strategies will guide developments along the corridor. \"This ensures that visitors can enjoy an uninterrupted view of greenery throughout the corridor, without tall buildings looming over them where we can,\" he added. Mr Takayuki Kawada, 41, who previously lived in Singapore and had returned on a business trip, said he was paying a visit to the railway station after finding out online that it had been restored. “It is important to keep historical architecture to remember past stories and retain the culture of the area,” said Mr Kawada, who works in the energy sector. He added that during previous visits to the area, he could not enter the station. He was thrilled to find it open this time. Mr Lee said the authorities are currently working with student volunteers from the National University of Singapore's environmental studies programme to create an interactive online map of the central segment of the Rail Corridor, which will be launched in September. The authorities will continue to work with the community \"to realise the Rail Corridor's full potential\", said Mr Lee, who also announced forthcoming developments for the corridor. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim, who has documented the railway station, said he was glad of how the restoration work had turned out. “It was tastefully done, retaining the area’s rustic flavour and charm that takes you away from Singapore,” he said. Mr Leong Kwok Peng, a long-time advocate for the Rail Corridor to be kept as a continuous nature trail instead of being cut up for development, said he appreciated the effort made to restore the area, but would have liked to see more of the railway track restored. “We should bring back the rail to the rail corridor,” he said. “It would be nice to restore the track from the station up to the Bukit Timah truss bridge to retain the feel and enhance the photogenic value of the area. The stretch of retained tracks at the station is too short.” Noting that trains that used to traverse the line carried natural resources such as timber and rattan, he said: “We have taken so much, now it’s time we give back through the trail’s retention for nature.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - About 950,000 Singaporean households living in public flats will receive their second quarterly Goods and Services Tax Voucher (GSTV) - U-Save and GSTV  _ - service and conservancy charges (S&amp;amp;CC) rebates in July, said the Ministry of Finance on Friday (July 1). Payouts this month will range from $110 to $190 for the U-Save vouchers, and 0.5 or one month for the S&amp;amp;CC rebates. The payouts are identical across both schemes to those in April, with the exception that those living in three- and four-room Housing Board flats will receive 0.5 months in S&amp;amp;CC rebates, as opposed to a month in April. The rebates are part of the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme and the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022, and will \"provide continuing help to defray the GST and other living expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households\", according to the ministry in a press release. Eligible households will receive S&amp;amp;CC rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of their bills each year through the enhanced GST voucher scheme, with the rebates disbursed in April, July and October 2022, as well as January 2023. The U-Save rebates have been doubled this financial year from last year, and will total to a maximum of about 10 months in utility bills for the average household in one- and two-room HDB flats, and up to about six months for three- and four-room flats. A total of $720 million will be disbursed this financial year through the two rebates, with families receiving between $440 and $760 in U-Save rebates, depending on their HDB flat type. The disbursement of this tranche of vouchers comes amid global uncertainties and rising domestic prices of household essentials as such food, as well as rising electricity tariffs. The rebates are also in addition to the $100 household utilities credit which will be given to all Singaporean households, and separately announced on June 21 under the $1.5 billion Support Package. For those eligible, the payout comes as a relief, amid the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and increase in cost of living. “There’s been a sudden increase in prices, from chicken to electricity tariffs. It has been tough,” said piano teacher Rena Sim, 46, who lives in a five-room HDB flat. “With the vouchers, I’m grateful to have a little extra for my expenses.” Madam Zahreen Yusoff, 61, who lives in a four-room flat, said: “As a retiree, every cent counts. With the U-Save rebate, I have a little more to spend on my monthly household expenditure and can better plan my expenses without worrying for at least a month.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - From July 1, charges for some Covid-19 care will rise, the retirement age will be 63 and there will be fewer spots for smokers to light up. There are also new rules for foreign-registered vehicles here. Here's what you need to know. • Medically vulnerable People who are medically vulnerable with specific conditions may self-declare their health conditions to get their second Covid-19 vaccine booster at any vaccination centre or Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics that offer vaccination. This group includes patients aged 18 and above with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, asthma, liver cirrhosis, stroke and cancer under active treatment, among others. • Subsidies for respiratory infections Subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This means the flat $5 to $10 fee for such infections will no longer apply, though Singaporeans may still get other subsidies under other schemes. • Telemedicine Telemedicine subsidies for those who are mildly symptomatic and recovering at home will also revert to pre-pandemic levels. This refers to people under the Ministry of Health’s Protocol 2 definition for Covid-19 recovery. Those under Protocol 1, who are at high medical risk or have severe symptoms but were discharged to a home setting, will continue to receive fully subsidised telemedicine care. • Emergency department charges Emergency department charges for vaccinated Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with Covid-19 will also no longer be waived in all cases. Those who are deemed not to require hospital admission or treatment at a dedicated facility will not have their charges waived, but those who are assessed to require admission or treatment will continue to have their charges and inpatient bills fully subsidised. The smoking ban will now cover more areas, including all public parks and gardens, 10 recreational beaches, and sites managed by national water agency PUB under its Active, Beautiful and Clean waters programme. Work pass holders living in Singapore will no longer be allowed to keep and use their foreign-registered vehicles here. They must ensure that their vehicles are kept or used outside Singapore for six hours or more every day, which was the policy before borders were shut. The retirement age will be raised to 63 and the re-employment age to 68. This is part of a move to progressively raise the retirement and re-employment ages for Singapore workers to 65 and 70 years, to support older Singaporeans who wish to continue working to do so.</td>\n",

A cat named Hobbes on TikTok also suffers from balding as a result of his friend's aggressive grooming. To solve the issue, his cat owner decided to put on unique-looking hats on Hobbes to cover his balding patch. \"Poor Hobbes was balding,\" Hobbes's owner shared in a TikTok video. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats. Hobbes has been showing off some unique-looking hats on TikTok. Looking at the cause of all his problems with an orange on his head. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok.

In the same TikTok video, the cat's owner said that she is trying to teach Juan to be less aggressive with his licks. Meanwhile, with the help of his cool hats, it (hopefully) wouldn't be long before Hobbe's missing patch of fur grows back. â¬ Cupid â Twin Ver.

He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report.

A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com   \n",

This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash   \n",

The police, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, administered a stern warning to the 59-year-old man on Jul. 3, 2023, for an offence of negligence concerning his pet peacock, the Singapore Police Force told Mothership. According to the police, the man has since given his peacock away and has paid compensation to the victim's family. On Nov. 28, 2021, the three-year-old girl was walking with her family along Tavistock Avenue when they spotted a house with a peacock. The girl's mother, Kris Chan, noted that the gate to the house was \"wide open\", and the peacock was inside the compound. However, when the three-year-old stood outside the gate and looked in, the peacock charged out and \"aggressively\" attacked the child. The family and the peacock's owner were then locked in a dispute over who should take responsibility for the attack. After apparently consulting their lawyers and the Animal &amp; Veterinary Service (AVS), the owner maintained he was not at fault as the girl reportedly provoked the peacock by staring at it. The owner also apparently said he would decide how much to compensate the family after the medical bill has been tallied, if at all. In Singapore, it is legal to keep up to 10 non-commercial poultry, which includes peacocks. In response to Mothership's queries, Chan shared that she was disappointed with the results since the owner had been issued previous warnings before and that she provided the authorities evidence of other incidents involving multiple other victims prior to her daughter. \"We just hope to close the chapter and move on,\" she said. Speaking to The Straits Times (ST),Â Chan said that her family had to file a civil suit against the owner for him to pay for their daughter's medical fees. Chan also shared that her now five-year-old daughter has developed a fear of all animals, including dogs, cats and chickens. When her family visits friends with dogs at home, the dogs need to be muzzled and kept in a separate room. \"She's gradually getting better. We finally started going to the zoo again only this year,\" Chan said to ST. Top photos via Kris Chan/Facebook &amp; Mandy How   \n",

Prices of Spotify plans are going up between S$1 and S$2, and will go into effect immediately for new sign-ups. However, current subscribers are given a month's \"grace\", meaning that their prices will not go up until August, or September in some cases. The new prices are as follows:     The new and current prices: Screenshot via Spotify The previous pricing plan, as of Mar. 25 2023. Screenshot from the Internet Archive, via Spotify Spotify is available as a free, ad-supported service. But users on Premium plans can use the service ad-free, as well as downloading music and podcasts to listen to offline. However, unlike Netflix, Spotify users cannot share accounts, as playing music on one device automatically stops it playing on another connected device. Spotify's press release boast of over 200 million users, and those users in 46 countries will encounter the price increases. Those countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many European nations. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Indonesia will also see their prices increase, although Malaysia seems to have remained the same for now. Spotify is not the only service seeking more revenue from their subscriptions, with The Verge reporting that services, such as Apple Music and YouTube Premium, have also increased by about US$1 in the past year. Netflix recently moved to restrict users from sharing passwords, traditionally a perk of the service. Users in over 100 countries including Singapore are now required to pay an additional fee in order to add a user from outside their households. While there was initially some uncertainty what the response to such a change might be, The Verge reported in June that Netflix enjoyed an increase in paid subscriptions. So look out for more price hikes. Top image via Unsplash   \n",

       SINGAPORE - The first half of July is expected to be warmer and drier, after a rainy June, said the weatherman on Friday (July 1). The mercury is set to hit a high of around 35 deg C on several days while some nights are expected to be warm, with temperatures of about 28 deg C. Some relief could come in the second week, with thundery showers expected between the late morning and afternoon in some parts on several days. But most parts of the island are expected to experience below average rainfall, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). The dry and warm conditions are due to a mass of dry air moving eastward from the Indian Ocean over the region, it added. The prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are also expected to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region. This monsoon season typically extends into September and is a drier period compared with other times of the year. The daily maximum temperature in July is forecast to be between 33 deg C and 34 deg C, slightly higher than the 32 deg C to 34 deg C on many days in June. June was cooler overall compared with the weather in May, as it saw more rainy days, with almost all parts of the island receiving above average rainfall.   \n",

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1). Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales. The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon. With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec). The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex). Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell). The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest. After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card). Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations. For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card). Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month. Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions. Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire. But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices. Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits. According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade. Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year.   \n",
       "2267  SINGAPORE - After two years of restoration works, the Bukit Timah Railway Station and Railway Staff Quarters, located at about the midpoint of the 24km Rail Corridor, have reopened to the public. Visitors can now learn about the former railway line's history in the heritage gallery housed in the old railway station and relax at a cafe inside the former staff quarters, as well as enjoy new amenities, gardens and lawns. Officiating at the opening of the new 4.3ha Bukit Timah Railway Station community node on Friday (July 1), National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the public had been engaged on how to preserve the station's heritage. He said restoration plans had taken in an in-depth study of the site by Singapore University of Technology and Design students. Accessibility for people on wheelchairs, seniors, and families with young children was also taken into consideration. The node is located right by the Bukit Timah truss bridge and is most easily accessed from the King Albert Park MRT station. \"We have now conserved its two buildings and ensured that they are safe and accessible for everyone while retaining their nostalgic charm,\" said Mr Lee. For instance, in the railway station's signal room, six original levers used by station masters to control track switching and signalling for passing trains were kept. New gardens to enhance the station's character were also added, such as the Kampung Garden, which contains species including the hibiscus, peacock flower and jasmine found in 1960s kampungs here. Night lighting in the area will be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing nocturnal animals, said Mr Lee. Friday marks exactly 11 years since the 24km stretch of land occupied by the Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway line was returned to Singapore. Bukit Timah was one of several stations on the line, with the southern terminus being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) said visitors inside the Bukit Timah station building will get to see a ticketing booth and a replica of a signals diagram in the station's signal room. Conservator Yeo Kang Shua, who was the restoration project’s heritage consultant, said that while it was technically straightforward, the challenges lay in the relatively small scale of the heritage buildings. Workers had to be extremely cautious, he said, as any mistake they made would have damaged a significant percentage of the buildings given their size. For instance, special care was given to 20 half-domed ventilation tiles that were retained as part of the buildings’ roofs and are no longer in production. In front of the building, which was built in 1932, more restored features can be found, such as station signs and token poles. There are also replicas of railway station wagons that were used as railway maintenance vehicles. URA executive architect John Wan said the agency wanted to make the site relevant and used by the public, hence the wagons were introduced as a play feature and photo opportunity. At the former staff quarters, located opposite the old rail tracks from the station building, a cafe has opened at one of the two houses, offering local and fusion fare. Next door, a \"heritage wing\" has been created, retaining the layout, features and details of the house to showcase its former use as a residential building. Here, the toilet block has been spruced up and provides a showcase for how sanitation systems have evolved over past decades through displays of night-soil collection, a septic tank for on-site waste treatment and a modern sanitary system of underground lines with inspection chambers and a grease trap. Mr Marcus Wang, who owns 1932 Story, the new cafe in the staff quarters, said he was enticed to place a bid for the space having previously lived close to the railway line in a kampung near the former Bukit Timah Fire Station. “The request by NParks was not for a modern cafe, but one that reflected the olden times and as a furniture-maker, I thought I could contribute my passion,” said Mr Wang, who decorated the cafe space with some antiques of his own such as an old television. Last month, the Rail Corridor was identified as one of five identity corridors by URA in its heritage and identity structure plan. \"This means that we will plan the entire 24km length of the Rail Corridor with an intent to preserve this unique character,\" said Mr Lee on Friday. For instance, he said urban design strategies will guide developments along the corridor. \"This ensures that visitors can enjoy an uninterrupted view of greenery throughout the corridor, without tall buildings looming over them where we can,\" he added. Mr Takayuki Kawada, 41, who previously lived in Singapore and had returned on a business trip, said he was paying a visit to the railway station after finding out online that it had been restored. “It is important to keep historical architecture to remember past stories and retain the culture of the area,” said Mr Kawada, who works in the energy sector. He added that during previous visits to the area, he could not enter the station. He was thrilled to find it open this time. Mr Lee said the authorities are currently working with student volunteers from the National University of Singapore's environmental studies programme to create an interactive online map of the central segment of the Rail Corridor, which will be launched in September. The authorities will continue to work with the community \"to realise the Rail Corridor's full potential\", said Mr Lee, who also announced forthcoming developments for the corridor. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim, who has documented the railway station, said he was glad of how the restoration work had turned out. “It was tastefully done, retaining the area’s rustic flavour and charm that takes you away from Singapore,” he said. Mr Leong Kwok Peng, a long-time advocate for the Rail Corridor to be kept as a continuous nature trail instead of being cut up for development, said he appreciated the effort made to restore the area, but would have liked to see more of the railway track restored. “We should bring back the rail to the rail corridor,” he said. “It would be nice to restore the track from the station up to the Bukit Timah truss bridge to retain the feel and enhance the photogenic value of the area. The stretch of retained tracks at the station is too short.” Noting that trains that used to traverse the line carried natural resources such as timber and rattan, he said: “We have taken so much, now it’s time we give back through the trail’s retention for nature.”   \n",

Payouts this month will range from $110 to $190 for the U-Save vouchers, and 0.5 or one month for the S&amp;CC rebates. The payouts are identical across both schemes to those in April, with the exception that those living in three- and four-room Housing Board flats will receive 0.5 months in S&amp;CC rebates, as opposed to a month in April. The rebates are part of the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme and the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022, and will \"provide continuing help to defray the GST and other living expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households\", according to the ministry in a press release. Eligible households will receive S&amp;CC rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of their bills each year through the enhanced GST voucher scheme, with the rebates disbursed in April, July and October 2022, as well as January 2023. The U-Save rebates have been doubled this financial year from last year, and will total to a maximum of about 10 months in utility bills for the average household in one- and two-room HDB flats, and up to about six months for three- and four-room flats. A total of $720 million will be disbursed this financial year through the two rebates, with families receiving between $440 and $760 in U-Save rebates, depending on their HDB flat type. The disbursement of this tranche of vouchers comes amid global uncertainties and rising domestic prices of household essentials as such food, as well as rising electricity tariffs. The rebates are also in addition to the $100 household utilities credit which will be given to all Singaporean households, and separately announced on June 21 under the $1.5 billion Support Package. For those eligible, the payout comes as a relief, amid the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and increase in cost of living. “There’s been a sudden increase in prices, from chicken to electricity tariffs. It has been tough,” said piano teacher Rena Sim, 46, who lives in a five-room HDB flat. “With the vouchers, I’m grateful to have a little extra for my expenses.” Madam Zahreen Yusoff, 61, who lives in a four-room flat, said: “As a retiree, every cent counts. With the U-Save rebate, I have a little more to spend on my monthly household expenditure and can better plan my expenses without worrying for at least a month.”   \n",

There are also new rules for foreign-registered vehicles here. Here's what you need to know. • Medically vulnerable People who are medically vulnerable with specific conditions may self-declare their health conditions to get their second Covid-19 vaccine booster at any vaccination centre or Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics that offer vaccination. This group includes patients aged 18 and above with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, asthma, liver cirrhosis, stroke and cancer under active treatment, among others. • Subsidies for respiratory infections Subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This means the flat $5 to $10 fee for such infections will no longer apply, though Singaporeans may still get other subsidies under other schemes. • Telemedicine Telemedicine subsidies for those who are mildly symptomatic and recovering at home will also revert to pre-pandemic levels. This refers to people under the Ministry of Health’s Protocol 2 definition for Covid-19 recovery. Those under Protocol 1, who are at high medical risk or have severe symptoms but were discharged to a home setting, will continue to receive fully subsidised telemedicine care. • Emergency department charges Emergency department charges for vaccinated Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with Covid-19 will also no longer be waived in all cases. Those who are deemed not to require hospital admission or treatment at a dedicated facility will not have their charges waived, but those who are assessed to require admission or treatment will continue to have their charges and inpatient bills fully subsidised. The smoking ban will now cover more areas, including all public parks and gardens, 10 recreational beaches, and sites managed by national water agency PUB under its Active, Beautiful and Clean waters programme. Work pass holders living in Singapore will no longer be allowed to keep and use their foreign-registered vehicles here. They must ensure that their vehicles are kept or used outside Singapore for six hours or more every day, which was the policy before borders were shut. The retirement age will be raised to 63 and the re-employment age to 68. This is part of a move to progressively raise the retirement and re-employment ages for Singapore workers to 65 and 70 years, to support older Singaporeans who wish to continue working to do so.   \n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Once hailed as the biggest outdoor television studio in the region, what remains of the now-defunct Tuas TV World is set to be demolished by the second quarter of 2024. The 6.6ha facility had eight sets, with five depicting old Singapore and three of China. It was built between 1990 and 1992 at the cost of about $35 million by Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) – an antecedent of Mediacorp. The complex also had a 215m-long water feature that mimicked the Singapore River, including pumps to generate waves. It is located between Tuas Checkpoint Complex and the Land Transport Authority’s upcoming Integrated Train Testing Centre. SBC representatives said in 1990 that when completed, Tuas TV World would be 40 times the size of an “early Singapore” set they had in Caldecott Hill, and allow the broadcaster to produce more dramas. These would include English, Malay and Indian dramas, which up till that point had been limited by the mostly Chinese-style set in Caldecott. It was previously reported that after about a decade of operations, Tuas TV World became too costly for the broadcaster to maintain, as fewer period dramas were produced after the 1990s. A spokesman for the Singapore Police Force told The Straits Times on Friday that the Special Operations Command leased the premises in December 2001 and converted it into a temporary facility called Tuas Training Village to meet training needs. Various police units – including land divisions and specialist units – used the site for various types of training, including public order incidents, public security, forensic investigations and scenario-based exercises, the spokesman added. He said training was ceased in 2009 to prepare the site to be returned to the state. Dramas filmed during TV World’s heyday in the 90s include Strange Encounters 3, Tofu Street, The Price Of Peace, Wok Of Life and Hainan Kopi Tales. Of TV World’s about 100 buildings, only around 15 remain today. It is unclear when the rest of the structures were removed, though veteran local actor Chew Chor Meng said during an interview in 2012 that some buildings had already been torn down. The 54-year-old, who had filmed about 10 dramas at the site, was among the actors who returned to TV World in February that year, when Mediacorp returned to the location to film Channel 8’s 30th anniversary period drama Joys Of Life. Speaking with The New Paper then, Mr Chew said he had many fond memories of TV World, including fishing in a nearby water body during filming breaks. Mr Chew, who brought his wife and two daughters to TV World in 2012 to show them where he previously worked, said that the site is part of Singapore’s drama history and part of the collective memory of actors around his age. Veteran producer Winnie Wong, who retired in 2021 after more than 40 years in the television industry, told ST on Sunday that returning to TV World to film Joys Of Life – on which she was an executive producer – was fitting as the facility had played an integral part in the development of the local TV industry, having supported a boom in Singapore-made dramas in the 90s. She said that, given TV World’s significant size advantage compared with the old set in Caldecott Hill, producers could do a lot more in their shows, and find new ways to wow audiences. “At the Caldecott set, we had only two streets, and no matter how we tried, audiences would eventually tire of seeing the same thing. “There were only that many things you could do with it, like changing the names of shops,” said Ms Wong, who added that those who grew up watching local dramas in the 90s would also share an indirect bond with TV World. Actors and crew who have worked at TV World all have lasting memories of it, and of time spent together there, she said. “We had no mobile phones then, and Tuas was so far out, there was nowhere to go during filming breaks… so we would spend the whole day together, have meals on set and talk about life,” said Ms Wong. “It was a period when the camaraderie we shared was very strong.” Even in its rundown state in 2012, said Ms Wong, the set still had character and impressed late Taiwanese actor Alien Huang, who starred in Joys Of Life. While similar settings depicting Singapore in the mid-1900s are difficult to find elsewhere on the island, shows set in this period are not filmed often now, said Ms Wong. She pointed out that keeping the set around for such instances is onerous, as much effort has to be put into maintenance. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim said it is a shame that TV World was given up and will now be torn down. “Who would have thought that we had our own Singaporean version of a Hollywood type outdoor set?” he said. Tuas TV World’s remaining buildings sit on land zoned as a reserve site, meaning its specific use is yet to be determined. The Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to appoint a contractor in mid-September, following which demolition works will run till the second quarter of 2024 before the site is handed over to the Singapore Land Authority.</td>\n",

       "5999  SINGAPORE – Once hailed as the biggest outdoor television studio in the region, what remains of the now-defunct Tuas TV World is set to be demolished by the second quarter of 2024. The 6.6ha facility had eight sets, with five depicting old Singapore and three of China. It was built between 1990 and 1992 at the cost of about $35 million by Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) – an antecedent of Mediacorp. The complex also had a 215m-long water feature that mimicked the Singapore River, including pumps to generate waves. It is located between Tuas Checkpoint Complex and the Land Transport Authority’s upcoming Integrated Train Testing Centre. SBC representatives said in 1990 that when completed, Tuas TV World would be 40 times the size of an “early Singapore” set they had in Caldecott Hill, and allow the broadcaster to produce more dramas. These would include English, Malay and Indian dramas, which up till that point had been limited by the mostly Chinese-style set in Caldecott. It was previously reported that after about a decade of operations, Tuas TV World became too costly for the broadcaster to maintain, as fewer period dramas were produced after the 1990s. A spokesman for the Singapore Police Force told The Straits Times on Friday that the Special Operations Command leased the premises in December 2001 and converted it into a temporary facility called Tuas Training Village to meet training needs. Various police units – including land divisions and specialist units – used the site for various types of training, including public order incidents, public security, forensic investigations and scenario-based exercises, the spokesman added. He said training was ceased in 2009 to prepare the site to be returned to the state. Dramas filmed during TV World’s heyday in the 90s include Strange Encounters 3, Tofu Street, The Price Of Peace, Wok Of Life and Hainan Kopi Tales. Of TV World’s about 100 buildings, only around 15 remain today. It is unclear when the rest of the structures were removed, though veteran local actor Chew Chor Meng said during an interview in 2012 that some buildings had already been torn down. The 54-year-old, who had filmed about 10 dramas at the site, was among the actors who returned to TV World in February that year, when Mediacorp returned to the location to film Channel 8’s 30th anniversary period drama Joys Of Life. Speaking with The New Paper then, Mr Chew said he had many fond memories of TV World, including fishing in a nearby water body during filming breaks. Mr Chew, who brought his wife and two daughters to TV World in 2012 to show them where he previously worked, said that the site is part of Singapore’s drama history and part of the collective memory of actors around his age. Veteran producer Winnie Wong, who retired in 2021 after more than 40 years in the television industry, told ST on Sunday that returning to TV World to film Joys Of Life – on which she was an executive producer – was fitting as the facility had played an integral part in the development of the local TV industry, having supported a boom in Singapore-made dramas in the 90s. She said that, given TV World’s significant size advantage compared with the old set in Caldecott Hill, producers could do a lot more in their shows, and find new ways to wow audiences. “At the Caldecott set, we had only two streets, and no matter how we tried, audiences would eventually tire of seeing the same thing. “There were only that many things you could do with it, like changing the names of shops,” said Ms Wong, who added that those who grew up watching local dramas in the 90s would also share an indirect bond with TV World. Actors and crew who have worked at TV World all have lasting memories of it, and of time spent together there, she said. “We had no mobile phones then, and Tuas was so far out, there was nowhere to go during filming breaks… so we would spend the whole day together, have meals on set and talk about life,” said Ms Wong. “It was a period when the camaraderie we shared was very strong.” Even in its rundown state in 2012, said Ms Wong, the set still had character and impressed late Taiwanese actor Alien Huang, who starred in Joys Of Life. While similar settings depicting Singapore in the mid-1900s are difficult to find elsewhere on the island, shows set in this period are not filmed often now, said Ms Wong. She pointed out that keeping the set around for such instances is onerous, as much effort has to be put into maintenance. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim said it is a shame that TV World was given up and will now be torn down. “Who would have thought that we had our own Singaporean version of a Hollywood type outdoor set?” he said. Tuas TV World’s remaining buildings sit on land zoned as a reserve site, meaning its specific use is yet to be determined. The Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to appoint a contractor in mid-September, following which demolition works will run till the second quarter of 2024 before the site is handed over to the Singapore Land Authority.   \n",

The man paid a 5 per cent deposit of $115,000 for the $2.3 million apartment but got cold feet two weeks after signing the sales and purchase agreement and pulled out of the deal.   \n",

He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Two supermoons will be visible across Singapore in August 2023. This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash</td>\n",

       "      <td>The owner of the pet peacock that attacked a three-year-old girl on Nov. 28, 2021, was issued a stern warning. The police, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, administered a stern warning to the 59-year-old man on Jul. 3, 2023, for an offence of negligence concerning his pet peacock, the Singapore Police Force told Mothership. According to the police, the man has since given his peacock away and has paid compensation to the victim's family. On Nov. 28, 2021, the three-year-old girl was walking with her family along Tavistock Avenue when they spotted a house with a peacock. The girl's mother, Kris Chan, noted that the gate to the house was \"wide open\", and the peacock was inside the compound. However, when the three-year-old stood outside the gate and looked in, the peacock charged out and \"aggressively\" attacked the child. The family and the peacock's owner were then locked in a dispute over who should take responsibility for the attack. After apparently consulting their lawyers and the Animal &amp;amp; Veterinary Service (AVS), the owner maintained he was not at fault as the girl reportedly provoked the peacock by staring at it. The owner also apparently said he would decide how much to compensate the family after the medical bill has been tallied, if at all. In Singapore, it is legal to keep up to 10 non-commercial poultry, which includes peacocks. In response to Mothership's queries, Chan shared that she was disappointed with the results since the owner had been issued previous warnings before and that she provided the authorities evidence of other incidents involving multiple other victims prior to her daughter. \"We just hope to close the chapter and move on,\" she said. Speaking to The Straits Times (ST),Â Chan said that her family had to file a civil suit against the owner for him to pay for their daughter's medical fees. Chan also shared that her now five-year-old daughter has developed a fear of all animals, including dogs, cats and chickens. When her family visits friends with dogs at home, the dogs need to be muzzled and kept in a separate room. \"She's gradually getting better. We finally started going to the zoo again only this year,\" Chan said to ST. Top photos via Kris Chan/Facebook &amp;amp; Mandy How</td>\n",

Prices of Spotify plans are going up between S$1 and S$2, and will go into effect immediately for new sign-ups. However, current subscribers are given a month's \"grace\", meaning that their prices will not go up until August, or September in some cases. The new prices are as follows:     The new and current prices: Screenshot via Spotify The previous pricing plan, as of Mar. 25 2023. Screenshot from the Internet Archive, via Spotify Spotify is available as a free, ad-supported service. But users on Premium plans can use the service ad-free, as well as downloading music and podcasts to listen to offline. However, unlike Netflix, Spotify users cannot share accounts, as playing music on one device automatically stops it playing on another connected device. Spotify's press release boast of over 200 million users, and those users in 46 countries will encounter the price increases. Those countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many European nations. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Indonesia will also see their prices increase, although Malaysia seems to have remained the same for now. Spotify is not the only service seeking more revenue from their subscriptions, with The Verge reporting that services, such as Apple Music and YouTube Premium, have also increased by about US$1 in the past year. Netflix recently moved to restrict users from sharing passwords, traditionally a perk of the service. Users in over 100 countries including Singapore are now required to pay an additional fee in order to add a user from outside their households. While there was initially some uncertainty what the response to such a change might be, The Verge reported in June that Netflix enjoyed an increase in paid subscriptions. So look out for more price hikes. Top image via Unsplash</td>\n",

The mercury is set to hit a high of around 35 deg C on several days while some nights are expected to be warm, with temperatures of about 28 deg C. Some relief could come in the second week, with thundery showers expected between the late morning and afternoon in some parts on several days. But most parts of the island are expected to experience below average rainfall, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). The dry and warm conditions are due to a mass of dry air moving eastward from the Indian Ocean over the region, it added. The prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are also expected to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region. This monsoon season typically extends into September and is a drier period compared with other times of the year. The daily maximum temperature in July is forecast to be between 33 deg C and 34 deg C, slightly higher than the 32 deg C to 34 deg C on many days in June. June was cooler overall compared with the weather in May, as it saw more rainy days, with almost all parts of the island receiving above average rainfall.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Fuel pump prices have dipped across several brands - the first time since April. According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1). Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales. The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon. With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec). The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex). Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell). The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest. After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card). Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations. For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card). Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month. Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions. Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire. But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices. Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits. According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade. Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - After two years of restoration works, the Bukit Timah Railway Station and Railway Staff Quarters, located at about the midpoint of the 24km Rail Corridor, have reopened to the public. Visitors can now learn about the former railway line's history in the heritage gallery housed in the old railway station and relax at a cafe inside the former staff quarters, as well as enjoy new amenities, gardens and lawns. Officiating at the opening of the new 4.3ha Bukit Timah Railway Station community node on Friday (July 1), National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the public had been engaged on how to preserve the station's heritage. He said restoration plans had taken in an in-depth study of the site by Singapore University of Technology and Design students. Accessibility for people on wheelchairs, seniors, and families with young children was also taken into consideration. The node is located right by the Bukit Timah truss bridge and is most easily accessed from the King Albert Park MRT station. \"We have now conserved its two buildings and ensured that they are safe and accessible for everyone while retaining their nostalgic charm,\" said Mr Lee. For instance, in the railway station's signal room, six original levers used by station masters to control track switching and signalling for passing trains were kept. New gardens to enhance the station's character were also added, such as the Kampung Garden, which contains species including the hibiscus, peacock flower and jasmine found in 1960s kampungs here. Night lighting in the area will be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing nocturnal animals, said Mr Lee. Friday marks exactly 11 years since the 24km stretch of land occupied by the Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway line was returned to Singapore. Bukit Timah was one of several stations on the line, with the southern terminus being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) said visitors inside the Bukit Timah station building will get to see a ticketing booth and a replica of a signals diagram in the station's signal room. Conservator Yeo Kang Shua, who was the restoration project’s heritage consultant, said that while it was technically straightforward, the challenges lay in the relatively small scale of the heritage buildings. Workers had to be extremely cautious, he said, as any mistake they made would have damaged a significant percentage of the buildings given their size. For instance, special care was given to 20 half-domed ventilation tiles that were retained as part of the buildings’ roofs and are no longer in production. In front of the building, which was built in 1932, more restored features can be found, such as station signs and token poles. There are also replicas of railway station wagons that were used as railway maintenance vehicles. URA executive architect John Wan said the agency wanted to make the site relevant and used by the public, hence the wagons were introduced as a play feature and photo opportunity. At the former staff quarters, located opposite the old rail tracks from the station building, a cafe has opened at one of the two houses, offering local and fusion fare. Next door, a \"heritage wing\" has been created, retaining the layout, features and details of the house to showcase its former use as a residential building. Here, the toilet block has been spruced up and provides a showcase for how sanitation systems have evolved over past decades through displays of night-soil collection, a septic tank for on-site waste treatment and a modern sanitary system of underground lines with inspection chambers and a grease trap. Mr Marcus Wang, who owns 1932 Story, the new cafe in the staff quarters, said he was enticed to place a bid for the space having previously lived close to the railway line in a kampung near the former Bukit Timah Fire Station. “The request by NParks was not for a modern cafe, but one that reflected the olden times and as a furniture-maker, I thought I could contribute my passion,” said Mr Wang, who decorated the cafe space with some antiques of his own such as an old television. Last month, the Rail Corridor was identified as one of five identity corridors by URA in its heritage and identity structure plan. \"This means that we will plan the entire 24km length of the Rail Corridor with an intent to preserve this unique character,\" said Mr Lee on Friday. For instance, he said urban design strategies will guide developments along the corridor. \"This ensures that visitors can enjoy an uninterrupted view of greenery throughout the corridor, without tall buildings looming over them where we can,\" he added. Mr Takayuki Kawada, 41, who previously lived in Singapore and had returned on a business trip, said he was paying a visit to the railway station after finding out online that it had been restored. “It is important to keep historical architecture to remember past stories and retain the culture of the area,” said Mr Kawada, who works in the energy sector. He added that during previous visits to the area, he could not enter the station. He was thrilled to find it open this time. Mr Lee said the authorities are currently working with student volunteers from the National University of Singapore's environmental studies programme to create an interactive online map of the central segment of the Rail Corridor, which will be launched in September. The authorities will continue to work with the community \"to realise the Rail Corridor's full potential\", said Mr Lee, who also announced forthcoming developments for the corridor. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim, who has documented the railway station, said he was glad of how the restoration work had turned out. “It was tastefully done, retaining the area’s rustic flavour and charm that takes you away from Singapore,” he said. Mr Leong Kwok Peng, a long-time advocate for the Rail Corridor to be kept as a continuous nature trail instead of being cut up for development, said he appreciated the effort made to restore the area, but would have liked to see more of the railway track restored. “We should bring back the rail to the rail corridor,” he said. “It would be nice to restore the track from the station up to the Bukit Timah truss bridge to retain the feel and enhance the photogenic value of the area. The stretch of retained tracks at the station is too short.” Noting that trains that used to traverse the line carried natural resources such as timber and rattan, he said: “We have taken so much, now it’s time we give back through the trail’s retention for nature.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - About 950,000 Singaporean households living in public flats will receive their second quarterly Goods and Services Tax Voucher (GSTV) - U-Save and GSTV  _ - service and conservancy charges (S&amp;amp;CC) rebates in July, said the Ministry of Finance on Friday (July 1). Payouts this month will range from $110 to $190 for the U-Save vouchers, and 0.5 or one month for the S&amp;amp;CC rebates. The payouts are identical across both schemes to those in April, with the exception that those living in three- and four-room Housing Board flats will receive 0.5 months in S&amp;amp;CC rebates, as opposed to a month in April. The rebates are part of the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme and the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022, and will \"provide continuing help to defray the GST and other living expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households\", according to the ministry in a press release. Eligible households will receive S&amp;amp;CC rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of their bills each year through the enhanced GST voucher scheme, with the rebates disbursed in April, July and October 2022, as well as January 2023. The U-Save rebates have been doubled this financial year from last year, and will total to a maximum of about 10 months in utility bills for the average household in one- and two-room HDB flats, and up to about six months for three- and four-room flats. A total of $720 million will be disbursed this financial year through the two rebates, with families receiving between $440 and $760 in U-Save rebates, depending on their HDB flat type. The disbursement of this tranche of vouchers comes amid global uncertainties and rising domestic prices of household essentials as such food, as well as rising electricity tariffs. The rebates are also in addition to the $100 household utilities credit which will be given to all Singaporean households, and separately announced on June 21 under the $1.5 billion Support Package. For those eligible, the payout comes as a relief, amid the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and increase in cost of living. “There’s been a sudden increase in prices, from chicken to electricity tariffs. It has been tough,” said piano teacher Rena Sim, 46, who lives in a five-room HDB flat. “With the vouchers, I’m grateful to have a little extra for my expenses.” Madam Zahreen Yusoff, 61, who lives in a four-room flat, said: “As a retiree, every cent counts. With the U-Save rebate, I have a little more to spend on my monthly household expenditure and can better plan my expenses without worrying for at least a month.”</td>\n",

There are also new rules for foreign-registered vehicles here. Here's what you need to know. • Medically vulnerable People who are medically vulnerable with specific conditions may self-declare their health conditions to get their second Covid-19 vaccine booster at any vaccination centre or Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics that offer vaccination. This group includes patients aged 18 and above with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, asthma, liver cirrhosis, stroke and cancer under active treatment, among others. • Subsidies for respiratory infections Subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This means the flat $5 to $10 fee for such infections will no longer apply, though Singaporeans may still get other subsidies under other schemes. • Telemedicine Telemedicine subsidies for those who are mildly symptomatic and recovering at home will also revert to pre-pandemic levels. This refers to people under the Ministry of Health’s Protocol 2 definition for Covid-19 recovery. Those under Protocol 1, who are at high medical risk or have severe symptoms but were discharged to a home setting, will continue to receive fully subsidised telemedicine care. • Emergency department charges Emergency department charges for vaccinated Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with Covid-19 will also no longer be waived in all cases. Those who are deemed not to require hospital admission or treatment at a dedicated facility will not have their charges waived, but those who are assessed to require admission or treatment will continue to have their charges and inpatient bills fully subsidised. The smoking ban will now cover more areas, including all public parks and gardens, 10 recreational beaches, and sites managed by national water agency PUB under its Active, Beautiful and Clean waters programme. Work pass holders living in Singapore will no longer be allowed to keep and use their foreign-registered vehicles here. They must ensure that their vehicles are kept or used outside Singapore for six hours or more every day, which was the policy before borders were shut. The retirement age will be raised to 63 and the re-employment age to 68. This is part of a move to progressively raise the retirement and re-employment ages for Singapore workers to 65 and 70 years, to support older Singaporeans who wish to continue working to do so.</td>\n",

A cat named Hobbes on TikTok also suffers from balding as a result of his friend's aggressive grooming. To solve the issue, his cat owner decided to put on unique-looking hats on Hobbes to cover his balding patch. \"Poor Hobbes was balding,\" Hobbes's owner shared in a TikTok video. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats. Hobbes has been showing off some unique-looking hats on TikTok. Looking at the cause of all his problems with an orange on his head. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok.

In the same TikTok video, the cat's owner said that she is trying to teach Juan to be less aggressive with his licks. Meanwhile, with the help of his cool hats, it (hopefully) wouldn't be long before Hobbe's missing patch of fur grows back. â¬ Cupid â Twin Ver.

He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report.

A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com   \n",

This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash   \n",

The police, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, administered a stern warning to the 59-year-old man on Jul. 3, 2023, for an offence of negligence concerning his pet peacock, the Singapore Police Force told Mothership. According to the police, the man has since given his peacock away and has paid compensation to the victim's family. On Nov. 28, 2021, the three-year-old girl was walking with her family along Tavistock Avenue when they spotted a house with a peacock. The girl's mother, Kris Chan, noted that the gate to the house was \"wide open\", and the peacock was inside the compound. However, when the three-year-old stood outside the gate and looked in, the peacock charged out and \"aggressively\" attacked the child. The family and the peacock's owner were then locked in a dispute over who should take responsibility for the attack. After apparently consulting their lawyers and the Animal &amp; Veterinary Service (AVS), the owner maintained he was not at fault as the girl reportedly provoked the peacock by staring at it. The owner also apparently said he would decide how much to compensate the family after the medical bill has been tallied, if at all. In Singapore, it is legal to keep up to 10 non-commercial poultry, which includes peacocks. In response to Mothership's queries, Chan shared that she was disappointed with the results since the owner had been issued previous warnings before and that she provided the authorities evidence of other incidents involving multiple other victims prior to her daughter. \"We just hope to close the chapter and move on,\" she said. Speaking to The Straits Times (ST),Â Chan said that her family had to file a civil suit against the owner for him to pay for their daughter's medical fees. Chan also shared that her now five-year-old daughter has developed a fear of all animals, including dogs, cats and chickens. When her family visits friends with dogs at home, the dogs need to be muzzled and kept in a separate room. \"She's gradually getting better. We finally started going to the zoo again only this year,\" Chan said to ST. Top photos via Kris Chan/Facebook &amp; Mandy How   \n",

Prices of Spotify plans are going up between S$1 and S$2, and will go into effect immediately for new sign-ups. However, current subscribers are given a month's \"grace\", meaning that their prices will not go up until August, or September in some cases. The new prices are as follows:     The new and current prices: Screenshot via Spotify The previous pricing plan, as of Mar. 25 2023. Screenshot from the Internet Archive, via Spotify Spotify is available as a free, ad-supported service. But users on Premium plans can use the service ad-free, as well as downloading music and podcasts to listen to offline. However, unlike Netflix, Spotify users cannot share accounts, as playing music on one device automatically stops it playing on another connected device. Spotify's press release boast of over 200 million users, and those users in 46 countries will encounter the price increases. Those countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many European nations. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Indonesia will also see their prices increase, although Malaysia seems to have remained the same for now. Spotify is not the only service seeking more revenue from their subscriptions, with The Verge reporting that services, such as Apple Music and YouTube Premium, have also increased by about US$1 in the past year. Netflix recently moved to restrict users from sharing passwords, traditionally a perk of the service. Users in over 100 countries including Singapore are now required to pay an additional fee in order to add a user from outside their households. While there was initially some uncertainty what the response to such a change might be, The Verge reported in June that Netflix enjoyed an increase in paid subscriptions. So look out for more price hikes. Top image via Unsplash   \n",

       SINGAPORE - The first half of July is expected to be warmer and drier, after a rainy June, said the weatherman on Friday (July 1). The mercury is set to hit a high of around 35 deg C on several days while some nights are expected to be warm, with temperatures of about 28 deg C. Some relief could come in the second week, with thundery showers expected between the late morning and afternoon in some parts on several days. But most parts of the island are expected to experience below average rainfall, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). The dry and warm conditions are due to a mass of dry air moving eastward from the Indian Ocean over the region, it added. The prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are also expected to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region. This monsoon season typically extends into September and is a drier period compared with other times of the year. The daily maximum temperature in July is forecast to be between 33 deg C and 34 deg C, slightly higher than the 32 deg C to 34 deg C on many days in June. June was cooler overall compared with the weather in May, as it saw more rainy days, with almost all parts of the island receiving above average rainfall.   \n",

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1). Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales. The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon. With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec). The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex). Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell). The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest. After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card). Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations. For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card). Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month. Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions. Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire. But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices. Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits. According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade. Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year.   \n",
       "2267  SINGAPORE - After two years of restoration works, the Bukit Timah Railway Station and Railway Staff Quarters, located at about the midpoint of the 24km Rail Corridor, have reopened to the public. Visitors can now learn about the former railway line's history in the heritage gallery housed in the old railway station and relax at a cafe inside the former staff quarters, as well as enjoy new amenities, gardens and lawns. Officiating at the opening of the new 4.3ha Bukit Timah Railway Station community node on Friday (July 1), National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the public had been engaged on how to preserve the station's heritage. He said restoration plans had taken in an in-depth study of the site by Singapore University of Technology and Design students. Accessibility for people on wheelchairs, seniors, and families with young children was also taken into consideration. The node is located right by the Bukit Timah truss bridge and is most easily accessed from the King Albert Park MRT station. \"We have now conserved its two buildings and ensured that they are safe and accessible for everyone while retaining their nostalgic charm,\" said Mr Lee. For instance, in the railway station's signal room, six original levers used by station masters to control track switching and signalling for passing trains were kept. New gardens to enhance the station's character were also added, such as the Kampung Garden, which contains species including the hibiscus, peacock flower and jasmine found in 1960s kampungs here. Night lighting in the area will be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing nocturnal animals, said Mr Lee. Friday marks exactly 11 years since the 24km stretch of land occupied by the Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway line was returned to Singapore. Bukit Timah was one of several stations on the line, with the southern terminus being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the National Parks Board (NParks) said visitors inside the Bukit Timah station building will get to see a ticketing booth and a replica of a signals diagram in the station's signal room. Conservator Yeo Kang Shua, who was the restoration project’s heritage consultant, said that while it was technically straightforward, the challenges lay in the relatively small scale of the heritage buildings. Workers had to be extremely cautious, he said, as any mistake they made would have damaged a significant percentage of the buildings given their size. For instance, special care was given to 20 half-domed ventilation tiles that were retained as part of the buildings’ roofs and are no longer in production. In front of the building, which was built in 1932, more restored features can be found, such as station signs and token poles. There are also replicas of railway station wagons that were used as railway maintenance vehicles. URA executive architect John Wan said the agency wanted to make the site relevant and used by the public, hence the wagons were introduced as a play feature and photo opportunity. At the former staff quarters, located opposite the old rail tracks from the station building, a cafe has opened at one of the two houses, offering local and fusion fare. Next door, a \"heritage wing\" has been created, retaining the layout, features and details of the house to showcase its former use as a residential building. Here, the toilet block has been spruced up and provides a showcase for how sanitation systems have evolved over past decades through displays of night-soil collection, a septic tank for on-site waste treatment and a modern sanitary system of underground lines with inspection chambers and a grease trap. Mr Marcus Wang, who owns 1932 Story, the new cafe in the staff quarters, said he was enticed to place a bid for the space having previously lived close to the railway line in a kampung near the former Bukit Timah Fire Station. “The request by NParks was not for a modern cafe, but one that reflected the olden times and as a furniture-maker, I thought I could contribute my passion,” said Mr Wang, who decorated the cafe space with some antiques of his own such as an old television. Last month, the Rail Corridor was identified as one of five identity corridors by URA in its heritage and identity structure plan. \"This means that we will plan the entire 24km length of the Rail Corridor with an intent to preserve this unique character,\" said Mr Lee on Friday. For instance, he said urban design strategies will guide developments along the corridor. \"This ensures that visitors can enjoy an uninterrupted view of greenery throughout the corridor, without tall buildings looming over them where we can,\" he added. Mr Takayuki Kawada, 41, who previously lived in Singapore and had returned on a business trip, said he was paying a visit to the railway station after finding out online that it had been restored. “It is important to keep historical architecture to remember past stories and retain the culture of the area,” said Mr Kawada, who works in the energy sector. He added that during previous visits to the area, he could not enter the station. He was thrilled to find it open this time. Mr Lee said the authorities are currently working with student volunteers from the National University of Singapore's environmental studies programme to create an interactive online map of the central segment of the Rail Corridor, which will be launched in September. The authorities will continue to work with the community \"to realise the Rail Corridor's full potential\", said Mr Lee, who also announced forthcoming developments for the corridor. Heritage blogger and author Jerome Lim, who has documented the railway station, said he was glad of how the restoration work had turned out. “It was tastefully done, retaining the area’s rustic flavour and charm that takes you away from Singapore,” he said. Mr Leong Kwok Peng, a long-time advocate for the Rail Corridor to be kept as a continuous nature trail instead of being cut up for development, said he appreciated the effort made to restore the area, but would have liked to see more of the railway track restored. “We should bring back the rail to the rail corridor,” he said. “It would be nice to restore the track from the station up to the Bukit Timah truss bridge to retain the feel and enhance the photogenic value of the area. The stretch of retained tracks at the station is too short.” Noting that trains that used to traverse the line carried natural resources such as timber and rattan, he said: “We have taken so much, now it’s time we give back through the trail’s retention for nature.”   \n",

Payouts this month will range from $110 to $190 for the U-Save vouchers, and 0.5 or one month for the S&amp;CC rebates. The payouts are identical across both schemes to those in April, with the exception that those living in three- and four-room Housing Board flats will receive 0.5 months in S&amp;CC rebates, as opposed to a month in April. The rebates are part of the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme and the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022, and will \"provide continuing help to defray the GST and other living expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households\", according to the ministry in a press release. Eligible households will receive S&amp;CC rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of their bills each year through the enhanced GST voucher scheme, with the rebates disbursed in April, July and October 2022, as well as January 2023. The U-Save rebates have been doubled this financial year from last year, and will total to a maximum of about 10 months in utility bills for the average household in one- and two-room HDB flats, and up to about six months for three- and four-room flats. A total of $720 million will be disbursed this financial year through the two rebates, with families receiving between $440 and $760 in U-Save rebates, depending on their HDB flat type. The disbursement of this tranche of vouchers comes amid global uncertainties and rising domestic prices of household essentials as such food, as well as rising electricity tariffs. The rebates are also in addition to the $100 household utilities credit which will be given to all Singaporean households, and separately announced on June 21 under the $1.5 billion Support Package. For those eligible, the payout comes as a relief, amid the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and increase in cost of living. “There’s been a sudden increase in prices, from chicken to electricity tariffs. It has been tough,” said piano teacher Rena Sim, 46, who lives in a five-room HDB flat. “With the vouchers, I’m grateful to have a little extra for my expenses.” Madam Zahreen Yusoff, 61, who lives in a four-room flat, said: “As a retiree, every cent counts. With the U-Save rebate, I have a little more to spend on my monthly household expenditure and can better plan my expenses without worrying for at least a month.”   \n",

There are also new rules for foreign-registered vehicles here. Here's what you need to know. • Medically vulnerable People who are medically vulnerable with specific conditions may self-declare their health conditions to get their second Covid-19 vaccine booster at any vaccination centre or Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics that offer vaccination. This group includes patients aged 18 and above with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, asthma, liver cirrhosis, stroke and cancer under active treatment, among others. • Subsidies for respiratory infections Subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This means the flat $5 to $10 fee for such infections will no longer apply, though Singaporeans may still get other subsidies under other schemes. • Telemedicine Telemedicine subsidies for those who are mildly symptomatic and recovering at home will also revert to pre-pandemic levels. This refers to people under the Ministry of Health’s Protocol 2 definition for Covid-19 recovery. Those under Protocol 1, who are at high medical risk or have severe symptoms but were discharged to a home setting, will continue to receive fully subsidised telemedicine care. • Emergency department charges Emergency department charges for vaccinated Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with Covid-19 will also no longer be waived in all cases. Those who are deemed not to require hospital admission or treatment at a dedicated facility will not have their charges waived, but those who are assessed to require admission or treatment will continue to have their charges and inpatient bills fully subsidised. The smoking ban will now cover more areas, including all public parks and gardens, 10 recreational beaches, and sites managed by national water agency PUB under its Active, Beautiful and Clean waters programme. Work pass holders living in Singapore will no longer be allowed to keep and use their foreign-registered vehicles here. They must ensure that their vehicles are kept or used outside Singapore for six hours or more every day, which was the policy before borders were shut. The retirement age will be raised to 63 and the re-employment age to 68. This is part of a move to progressively raise the retirement and re-employment ages for Singapore workers to 65 and 70 years, to support older Singaporeans who wish to continue working to do so.   \n",

To solve the issue, his cat owner decided to put on unique-looking hats on Hobbes to cover his balding patch. \"Poor Hobbes was balding,\" Hobbes's owner shared in a TikTok video. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats. Hobbes has been showing off some unique-looking hats on TikTok. Looking at the cause of all his problems with an orange on his head. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok.

In the same TikTok video, the cat's owner said that she is trying to teach Juan to be less aggressive with his licks. Meanwhile, with the help of his cool hats, it (hopefully) wouldn't be long before Hobbe's missing patch of fur grows back. â¬ Cupid â Twin Ver.

       "      <td>A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com</td>\n",

A cat named Hobbes on TikTok also suffers from balding as a result of his friend's aggressive grooming. To solve the issue, his cat owner decided to put on unique-looking hats on Hobbes to cover his balding patch. \"Poor Hobbes was balding,\" Hobbes's owner shared in a TikTok video. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats. Hobbes has been showing off some unique-looking hats on TikTok. Looking at the cause of all his problems with an orange on his head. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok.

In the same TikTok video, the cat's owner said that she is trying to teach Juan to be less aggressive with his licks. Meanwhile, with the help of his cool hats, it (hopefully) wouldn't be long before Hobbe's missing patch of fur grows back. â¬ Cupid â Twin Ver.

       "1  A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com   \n",

Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats.

       "      <td>A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Two supermoons will be visible across Singapore in August 2023. This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash</td>\n",

A cat named Hobbes on TikTok also suffers from balding as a result of his friend's aggressive grooming. To solve the issue, his cat owner decided to put on unique-looking hats on Hobbes to cover his balding patch. \"Poor Hobbes was balding,\" Hobbes's owner shared in a TikTok video. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. Look closer and you'll see that the middle part of Hobbes's head had significantly sunk in. A close-up. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. The reason for Hobbes's receding fur? Not fungus or ringworm, but another pet cat named Juan who grooms him aggressively. Gifs via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok. To fight off Juan's aggressive grooming, their owner decided to use hats to cover Hobbes' balding patch. And not just any ordinary hats. Hobbes has been showing off some unique-looking hats on TikTok. Looking at the cause of all his problems with an orange on his head. Image via @juanwillworkfortreats/TikTok.

In the same TikTok video, the cat's owner said that she is trying to teach Juan to be less aggressive with his licks. Meanwhile, with the help of his cool hats, it (hopefully) wouldn't be long before Hobbe's missing patch of fur grows back. â¬ Cupid â Twin Ver.

       "1  A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                   Two supermoons will be visible across Singapore in August 2023. This phenomenon is rare, as it is uncommon to see two full moons within a single month and it happens every two to three years, according to the Science Centre Observatory. A supermoon occurs when the moonâs orbit is closest to our planet, making the moon appear larger and brighter than usual. The first Supermoon, the Sturgeon Moon, will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 1, according to the Science Centre Observatory. The Sturgeon Moon will be the second closest Supermoon to our planet this year out of four supermoons in 2023, with a distance of 357,581km from Earth at its nearest point. The Sturgeon Moon will begin rising at 7pm on Aug. 1, approximately from the southeast direction and should be at an appreciable height at 9pm onwards in Singapore. The Sturgeon Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 1am and continue setting towards the Southwest direction. The Sturgeon Moon will set at 7:25am on Aug. 2. The second supermoon is called the Blue Moon and will be visible in Singapore on Aug. 31. The Blue Moon is expected to be the brightest and closest Supermoon to the Earth in 2023. At its nearest point, the Blue Moon will be 357,182km from Earth. The Blue Moon will begin rising at 7:34pm on Aug. 31, approximately from the east direction. The moon may be at an appreciable height for viewing in Singapore 9pm onwards. The Blue Moon will continue rising till it reaches the Meridian -- the highest point in the sky that it will reach -- at 12:51am and continue setting towards the southwest direction. The Blue Moon will set at 7:03am on Sep. 1. The last Blue Moon was seen on Oct. 31, 2020, the Science Centre Observatory noted. The Blue Moon is not blue in colour. The term refers to the second full moon in a month and does not refer to the colour of the moon. While it may be very rare for a Blue Moon to appear blue, there are times when it can appear so due to the water droplets in the air, certain types of clouds, or particles thrown into the atmosphere by natural catastrophes, such as volcanic ash and smoke. This was seen during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, where ash particles in the air scattered red light and acted as a blue filter, resulting in the moon appearing blue, the Science Centre Observatory noted. Like most full moons, it will be easily visible anywhere in Singapore as long as the skies are clear and offer an unobstructed view, the Science Centre Observatory highlighted. For a better and potentially elevated view of the Sturgeon Moon and the Blue Moon with panoramic views of the city skyline, visit open public areas like the Marina Barrage, East Coast Park and the Southern Ridges. The last Supermoon of the year, the Harvest Moon, will be on Sep. 29. Top photo via Unsplash   \n",

       "      <td>A man in Beijing, China, has been arrested for extorting money and goods from restaurants, both Taiwanese and Chinese media reported. He went around doing so by putting cockroaches in his mouth and spitting them into his food to blackmail the restaurants. The actions of the man, surnamed Chen, came to light following an incident on Jun. 11, at a high-end restaurant located in Beijing's Ganjiakou subdistrict in Haidian. According to the manager of the restaurant, Chen showed the staff a cockroach after finishing his meal, claiming that he had eaten a foreign object in his food. The manager then proposed to withdraw his meal and provide him with a free order. A staff member further noted that Chen was \"unusually calm\" during negotiations. He eventually refused the restaurant's offer and decided to pay for his RMB280 meal (S$52) as per normal, and the restaurant staff assumed the matter was settled. Two hours later however, Chen made a phone call to the restaurant and demanded that he be compensated ten times the amount he paid for his meal. He also threatened to post the incident online. In order to preserve the restaurant's reputation, the manager, following negotiations with Chen, agreed to pay RMB1,000 (S$186) as compensation and buy him a packet of cigarettes. Following the incident, the restaurant staff, out of suspicion, decided to check the cockroach the man showed to them and found that it did not come from the dishes he ordered. How exactly the restaurant conducted its check was not reported. A staff member was further quoted byÂ ET Today as saying that the restaurant is strict about its hygiene standards and that they have a professional pest control team. Suspecting that they had been blackmailed, the restaurant made a police report. Source: Image via 163.com Chen was subsequently discovered by the police to be living in a hotel within the subdistrict and was arrested at his room. A can of chewing gum that was used to store cockroaches was found among his belongings, and was found to contain as many as 20 of the insects. Source: Image via 163.com Following this discovery, the man admitted to his scheme and said the rationale for his actions was because he was jobless and running out of money. According to Chen, he had bought the cockroaches in his hometown and cooked them, Chinese media further reported. Once he had cooked the cockroaches, he would pick some out to place inside the can. Prior to entering a restaurant, Chen would put one of the cockroaches in his mouth, then spit it out while he was eating his meal. Afterwards, he would show the cockroach to the restaurant's staff, initially refuse to receive a free order, then subsequently threaten them with blackmail. The police added that by targeting high-end restaurants with such a method, Chen was able to make RMB3,000 (S$558) as well as obtain other items such as cigarettes, alcohol and tea. Chen is currently under police detention, on suspicion of extortion. Top left photo by Roger Brown via Pexels, right image via via 163.com</td>\n",
